# Data-Visualisation

This repository contains data visualisations.

## Content

- **Altair Practice Project**: My first attempt at a visualisation using Altair.
- **Makeover Monday**: Every Monday the Makeover Monday team publishes a dataset and an accompanying data visualisation with the goal of encouraging people to improve on the visualisation. I am using Altair to create visualisations which can also be found here: https://lb930.github.io/Data-Science-Blog/.
